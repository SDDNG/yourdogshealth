# Your Dog's Health
This project consists of a static website which gives people an easy overview of the elements required for a dog to be healthy. It considers three main elements - diet, exercise and enrichment (i.e. mental stimulation). There is also a form page where someone could enter their name and email in order to register for a Newsletter and to receive a free ebook on dog's health. There is also an 'About' page which explains the background of the authors. Images of each page appear below (Note: was not sure how to paste images so looked up and found YouTube video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvPOUdz5PL4) which advised to create issues and drop screen caputures in and then to grab code from there):

## Existing Features
### Navigation Bar
Featured on all six pages, the full responsive navigation bar includes links to the Logo, Home page, Diet page, Exercise page, Enrichment page, Download page and the About page and is identical in each page to allow for easy navigation. This section will allow the user to easily navigate from page to page across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button. The page the user is currently residing on is given a grey background as is the one they hover over.

### The Page images
Each page features two appropriate photographs or images e.g. in the case of the diet page, one of the images is a figure showing how the body condition score for a dog is judged, on the enrichment page, photos of dogs socialising are featured.

### The Footer
The footer section includes links to the relevant social media sites for Your Dog's Health. The links will open to a new tab to allow easy navigation for the user.
The footer is valuable to the user as it encourages them to keep connected via social media.

### Download Guide
This page will allow the user to get signed up to Your Dog's Health to receive a newsletter and also to get a free download of an ebook with some advice on how to maintain their dog's health. The user will be asked to submit their first name, last name and email address.

### Responsive Design
The website was implemented with various media queries which restructured the page depending on the size of device it was being viewed on. When the device size drops below a certain size the structure of the pages changes so that the menu items are stacked vertically rather than horizontally.

### Features Left to Implement
A food calculator for dogs based on various information such as age, current weight, breed, type of food and activity level would be a good addition to the site.

## Testing
The site was tested for navigation, appearance and responsiveness on different device sizes. Initially when it was ported to GitHub pages there were issues with some filepath names and one of the html file names ('index' had been renamed to 'home') and these were addressed. Chrome, Firefox and Edge were all tested.

### Validator Testing
HTML
On the initial run through the official W3C validator, errors in the html files were flagged because of 'alt' attributes on links, there were changed to 'aria-labels' and the files then passed. 
CSS
On the initial run throught the W3C CSS Validator, it flagged that there was an invalid ‘float:center’ on a number of attributes in the CSS file, these were removed and no difference in the pages was noted, so the intended effect was redundant.
### Unfixed Bugs
There are no known unfixed bugs.

## Deployment
The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab then choose the GitHub Pages link.
From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
