        <p>Our dogs give us so many things, Rodney Habib and Dr Karen Shaw Baker writing in 
            The Forever Dog (hyperlink), noted how they provide owners with a reason to get 
            outside and exercise and give us unconditional love, the perfect antidote to a 
            stressful world. Indeed, according to Habib and Baker, studies show that dogs can 
            lower blood pressure, keep us active, reduce heart attack and stroke risk, boost 
            our self-esteem, encourage social engagement, force us to be outdoors in nature, 
            and trigger the release of potent chemicals in our bodies that make us feel safe, 
            connected, and content. One study linked dog ownership to a reduction in all-cause 
            mortality of 24% and we’ve also learned that dogs can help children develop 
            stronger immune systems and soothe the stressors of adolescence. No wonder, 
            the authors dubbed them “Humanity’s Best Friend”.
            Given all of this, surely, it’s our duty to provide for these perfect companions 
            to the very best of our ability, to give them all they need to lead their best 
            possible life. We believe that there are three essential elements to doing this, namely, exercise, diet and a fulfilling environment.  
            Finally, if don’t yet have a dog but are considering adding one to your family, we think this (https://www.dogzone.com/breeds/ )is a great place to start researching specific breeds.
