        <h2>Us and Our Dogs</h2>
        <p>We had pets as children and after much pleading from our sons, delaying and procrastination, we got 
            our first dog, 
            Sebastian, when our eldest son was 12 and his younger brother was 9. Sebastian is a Bernese 
            Mountain Dog and now 4 years old, so mature in body if not attitude. Bernese are a giant breed, 
            Sebastian is 50kg approximately, but despite their size, they are famously known for being very 
            soft and gentle. Recently Bernese have gotten a lot of coverage in Ireland (where we live) as 
            <a href="https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/another-glimpse-of-misneach-president-michael-d-higgins-new-puppy-40165468.html" target="_blank" 
            alt="Link to Irish Independent article discussing his Bernese Mountain Dogs">the President of 
            Ireland has two</a>. As long as you can manage the giant muddy paws and all-year round 
            shedding, the love you get in return is invaluable. In the last year we added our second dog, Fenrir, 
            a Broholmer (or Danish Mastiff), Fenrir is now 9 months old and weighs around 60kg with about 
            another 10kg to go. Just as with the 
            Bernese, Broholmers are extremely gentle breeds. Other than possibly bowling you over as they 
            exuberantly greet you in the morning as if they havenâ€™t seen you in years, the most danger either 
            breed poses is as a tripping hazard as they compete to be as close as possible to you at all times 
            including lying immediately behind anyone cooking at the stove.
