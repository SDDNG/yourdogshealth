        <h2>Dogs Love to Move</h2>
        <p>Unfortunately, just as the modern world conspires to make us less active and more sedentary, 
            our dogs are suffering from the same malaise. More than half of our pets are overweight or 
            obese and a key factor is a lack of exercise. Most dog breeds were originally bred to do demanding 
            jobs, for example the Corgi, a dog many people see as a cute couch companion,  used to herd cattle 
            for their owners by darting between the much larger animals nipping at their heels and avoiding 
            powerful retaliatory kicks from the hoofs. There were other dogs used for herding, hunting, 
            drafting, guarding and personal protection. Given these origins most breeds have specific exercise 
            requirements, according to 
            <a href="https://dogtime.com" target="_blank" aria-label="Link to dog information site dogtime.com">
                dogtime.com</a> most breeds need 30 to 60 minutes exercise a day. If you 
            have a gun dog such as a

            aria-label="Link to Dog Time entry for Weimaraner Dog Breed"> Weimaraner</a>, you could be looking at 
            2 hours daily and for most breeds some of this time should include off-lead time as well, in fact off 
            lead walks where the dog can regulate his own exercise may often be preferable. There are other 
            forms of exercise too such as drafting, swimming and dog sports such as agility, this page from the
