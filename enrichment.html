        <h2>Good Stimulation is Essential to Happiness</h2>
        <p>Physical <a href="exercise.html" aria-label="Link to exercise sub-page">exercise</a> alone isn’t enough to 
            ensure a healthy and happy dog, they need lots of stimulation. When you consider that many breeds 
            of dogs were intended to do quite demanding jobs such as working in teams to

             aria-label="Link to Wikipedia page explaining hunting dogs">hunting in unison with their owners</a>, 
            it’s clear that asking a dog to sit alone and stare at a wall 
            for hours a day is just asking for trouble. There are many games or tasks that can be given to your 
            best friend e.g. having to find their food rather than just giving it to them in a bowl or 
            doing obedience tasks, <a href="https://www.battersea.org.uk/fuelling-your-dogs-brain" target="_blank" 
            aria-label="Link to ideas for stimulating your dog at Battersea.org.uk ">here are some ideas</a>. 
            One easy thing to do that will enrich 
            your dog’s life is to give him time to stop frequently and smell their surroundings when on a lead 
            walk, they will spend a lot of time scenting when off lead as this is the way they interact with 
            the world. Another key thing to remember is that dogs are social animals, so exposing them to other 
            dogs in an appropriate setting when they are young and maintaining this throughout their life is one 
            of the best things you can do to have a happy dog. Finally, one great advantage to mentally 
            stimulating a dog is that it tires them out and you may not need quite as much time to
